# Adding Authentication To React Apps

I have revisited the [Adding Authentication To React Apps](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/22-authentication) developed in [this Udemy's section](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25889754) of the [React complete guide course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Way3@7p5NyTcdoy4JOp1EmXMa-WM0quvGcEHRy4ReqQZp90Da2k4nkcUo-tKa_e7e8zjf6g==/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## What i've changed

I've modified the estructure of the project using concepts acquired along the course to this point:

- Added the use of react-redux (replacing the use of Context)
- Added the use of @reduxjs/toolkit
- Added an api.js file
- Added the use of the axios/axios library instead of the built-in fetch function
- Added a custom hook to handle the api calls
- Added the React.lazy feature (even if not necessary due to the small size of the project)
